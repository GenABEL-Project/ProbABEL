***** v.0.2.0 (2012.06.10)
* The v.0.1-9e fix for working with prob files in pacoxph has been
  forward-ported to this branch as well (Lennart and Yurii).

* pacoxph will not be built by default, because it is quite buggy. See
  ./configure notes below on how to enable building it anyway (Lennart).

* ProbABEL can now (experimentally!) analyze binary traits accounting
  for relationship structure (thanks to Yurii and Nicola Pirastu). This
  adds '--mmscore' option for logistic regression. Important: compared
  to 'palinear' the matrix which should be supplied to palogist with
  --mmscore should contain an inverse of the correlation matrix (not the
  inverse of var-cov matrix, as is the case for 'palinear' with
  --mmscore). This matrix can be obtained through (GenABEL notation):

h2.object$InvSigma * h2.object$h2an$estimate[length(h2.object$h2an$estimate)]

  where h2.object is the object returned by 'polygenic()'. Documentation
  explains this procedure in more details; a wrapper function to prepare
  and export correct objects for ProbABEL is planned. (thanks to Yurii)

* Small changes (thanks to Lennart).
- in probabel.pl the location for the probabel config file is now set
  to /etc/, the default location it will end up. Before it still
  pointed to the location the probabel.pl file was in. However, a
  better fix would be to somehow put in the actual value of the
  --sysconfdir option to ./configure.
- The PDF of the LaTeX documentation is now only generated if the
  pdflatex binary can be found. So now we also build the documentation
  using autotools.


* ProbABEL uses autoconf and automake now (thanks to Lennart).
  After downloading the source from SVN run
autoreconf -i

  to generate the ./configure script and some other files (this is not
  necessary when installing from the distributed .tar.gz file).

  To compile and install the package run
./configure
make
make check
make install

  This will install the binaries (palinear etc.) in /usr/local/bin/,
  the documentation in /usr/local/share/doc/probabel/, the
  probabel_config.cfg file in /usr/local/etc/, and the examples in
  /usr/local/share/ProbABEL/examples/. The ./configure script tests
  for the presence of the pdflatex program. If it is not present the
  PDF version of the documentation will not be built.

  NOTE: make install will OVERWRITE any file with the same name if it
  already exists. Also the probabel_config.cfg file in
  /usr/local/etc, even if the user modified it with his/her own
  settings. This is one reason why using the package manager for your
  distribution (apt for Debian, yum for RHEL, CentOS, etc., pkgtools
  for Slackware) is recommended. Package managers do note that a file
  has user-made changes and ask what to do (or make a backup).

  To see options, run

./configure --help

  The most notable option is
./configure --prefix=/some/subdirectory
  to install ProbABEL in that subdirectory. Instead of using
  /usr/local/ as install root, it installs in /some/subdirectory.

  The second important option is
./configure --enable-pacoxph
  this enables the building of the pacoxph binary.

  To generate a .tar.gz package for distribution run:
./configure
make dist

  To test if all your changes to the source files will be packaged
  into the tar.gz file correctly run
./configure
make distcheck

  To clean up all files generated by ./configure and make, run
make distclean


In the ProbABEL autotools integration branch:
- Removed the old Makefile
- Added configure.ac that servers as input for auto(re)conf
- Added the Makefile.am files needed by automake to generate the final Makefiles.


***** v.0.1-9e (2011.05.15)
Previous version wouldn't compile because of missing frerror. file.
Fixes bug #1339 (the bug fix was done a month ago, but no package had
been release since then).

***** v.0.1-9d (2010.10.08)

fix related to compilation with updated 'filevector' library

***** v.0.1-9c (2010.08.01)

Bug identification and fix by Vadim Pinchuk (McGill). Here is his report:

I have found a small bug that caused reporting of incorrect
subject IDs in the error message when I tried to run palinear
analysis. It caused a bit of confusion on my side.
... I fixed it in downloaded copy of the source code and it reports
correct subject IDs. We were able to overcome the problems in the data
after the fix and submit analysis successfully.

Bravo, Vadim! Thumbs up, and many thanks from us (and of course all users)!


***** v.0.1-9b (2010.06.02)

changes in filevector part

***** v.0.1-9 (2010.05.28)

changes in filevector part

cox regression does not work

***** v.0.1-8 (2010.05.10)

changes in filevector part

***** v.0.1-6b (2010.04.22)

error message with missing map-file reported absence of
other file, fixed: thanks to N. Pirastu for noticing!

***** v.0.1-6 (2010.04.02)

bug fix in palogist, coxph (would not run with missing genotypic data present)

Thanks to Ida Surakka, Pau Navarro and Kati Kristiansson for spotting the problem!

***** v.0.1-5 (2010.03.07)

Use of updated FILEVECTOR (r300)

Fixed bug preventing coxph to run

***** v.0.1-4 (2010.02.12)

Instead chi2, log-likelihood is reported

ProbABEL can now work in very low memory mode, using filevector library
(see examples/prepare_data.R for examples how to convert data from
MACH to filevector format).

Can also treat missing values (NA, nan)

***** v.0.1-3 (2009.11.25)

This version is courtesy of Han Chen (Nov 9, 2009). The modifications allow
to extract the covariance between the estimate of beta(SNP) and the estimate
of beta(interaction). This information can be used to, e.g., to perform a
rigorous 2df meta-analysis of interactions later on.

Here is a more detailed description of what the changes concern (by Han Chen):

For model

Y = b_0 + b_cov1 * cov1 + b_cov2 * cov2 + ... + b_covN * covN + b_SNP * SNP + b_covX_SNP * covX * SNP

(1<=X<=N, covX can be any covariate in the phenotype file, from cov1 to covN,
option --interaction=X, see ProbABEL manual for details)
Or model

Y = b_0 + b_cov1 * cov1 + b_cov2 * cov2 + ... + b_covX-1 * covX-1 + b_covX+1 * covX+1 + ... + b_covN * covN + b_SNP * SNP + b_covX_SNP * covX * SNP

(1<=X<=N, covX can be any covariate in the phenotype file, from cov1 to covN,
option --interaction_only=X, see ProbABEL manual for details)
This "plus" version reports naive covariance (default) or robust covariance
(option --robust) between b_SNP and b_covX_SNP estimates, for palinear and
palogist (can NOT report covariance for pacoxph, Cox regression).
Covariances are no reported for options --score, --allcov, --mmscore

LINEAR REGRESSION OR LOGISTIC REGRESSION ONLY

Bravo, Han! -- and many thanks!


***** v.0.1-2 (2009.10.19)

Minor bug fix: allele frequency was estimated wrongly when option --ngpreds=2
was used. The bug had no effect anything else (betas, ses, chi2s were correct).
Many thanks to Han Chen (Boston University) for identification of this bug
and providing us with an excellent summary which allowed fixing the bug easily!

***** v.0.1-1 (2009.09.22)

Added "robust" option, which computes SEs using formula
(X'X)^(-1) (X' V X) (X'X)^(-1) where V is diagonal matrix containing
squares of residuals. In standard analysis, V is diagonal matrix
containing constant = RSS/N

***** v.0.1-0 (2009.08.15)

fixed a bug in phedata class: if ID was starting with 'N' or 'n', it
was counted as NA (thanks to Youfan & Ida Surakka for pointing the
bug out)


***** v.0.0-9 (2009.07.20)

mmscore bug fixed (ses of betas were inflated by sd of the trait's distribution)


***** v.0.0-8 (2009.06.09)

1. New interaction option added. Key --interaction_only=<number> allows you to perform interaction analysis without covariate acting in ineraction.
Examlple: trait ~ cov1 + cov2 + cov3*SNP
In previos versions only models like trait ~ cov1 + cov2 + cov3 + cov3*SNP were possible

2. mmoscore option modified. Now any amount of covariates is possible.


***** v.0.0-7 (2009.03.19)

Bug with interaction in survival analysis fixed.


***** v.0.0-6 (2009.01.28)

Added score test for association between a trait and genetic
polymorphism, in samples of related individuals.
Use key --mmscore <file with inverse of variance-covariance matrix>
File must contain the first column with id names like in phenotype file.
The rest is the matrix itself.
In case of mmscore phenotype file contain only two columns - id names and trait.

See example/mmscore.R and example/mmscore.sh.


***** v.0.0-5d (2009.01.11)

Possibility of analysis for SNP interaction has been added.
New key is --interaction=<covariate number>.
Default is --interaction=0. The first covariate is --interaction=1.

Output organizing has been changed. Now there is one file per one model.
Output file names consist of prefix which goes together with input
parameter --out and one of following postfixes:
"_2df.out.txt", "_add.out.txt", "_domin.out.txt", "_recess.out.txt", "_over_domin.out.txt".
If postfix is not given name "regression" is used.


File bin/probabel_system_example.pl has been changedand renamed
to probabel.pl_example. This script combines all ProbABEL functions and allows
you to organize work with your MACH output files. Just change configuration
file probabel_config.cfg_example and probabel.pl_example like it is written in manual.

Now chi2 is likelihood ration test when null model is without SNP and alternative - with SNP and interaction.


***** v.0.0-5c (2008.12.05)

Changed presentation of output: effective allele (A1) is mentioned
in exact manner


***** v.0.0-5b (2008.11.20)

Output from analysis with ngpred=2 (MLPROB files) fixed (models were
named wrongly)


***** v.0.0-5a (2008.10.05)

--allcov option added (allows output of estimates for all covariates)

example system-wide perl script running the analysis for
(potentially multiple cohorts) and joining single-chomosome
outputs to single file provided

A change in the procedure to read genotypic files, read format of the
beging of every line changed from "%d->%s" to "%[^->]->%[^->]" (thanks to
Bertram Muller-Myhsok & Benno Puetz)


***** v.0.0-5 (2008.06.07)

More than one genomic predictor per point: possibility to
work with MLPROB files (options --ngpreds added).


***** v.0.0-4 (2008.05.20)

Score test implemented (palinear, palogistic)

Logistic regression: eps-loglikelihood change as convergence criterium


***** v.0.0-3

Survival analysis added

SNP Z and Chi-square statistics added to output

Output generated in tab-delimited format

Documentation updated
