***** v.0.1-6 (2010.04.02)

bug fix in palogist, coxph (would not run with missing genotypic data present)

Thanks to Ida Surakka, Pau Navarro and Kati Kristiansson for spotting the problem!

***** v.0.1-5 (2010.03.07)

Use of updated FILEVECTOR (r300)

Fixed bug preventing coxph to run

***** v.0.1-4 (2010.02.12)

Instead chi2, log-likelihood is reported 

ProbABEL can now work in very low memory mode, using filevector library
(see examples/prepare_data.R for examples how to convert data from 
MACH to filevector format).

Can also treat missing values (NA, nan)

***** v.0.1-3 (2009.11.25)

This version is courtesy of Han Chen (Nov 9, 2009). The modifications allow
to extract the covariance between the estimate of beta(SNP) and the estimate 
of beta(interaction). This information can be used to, e.g., to perform a 
rigorous 2df meta-analysis of interactions later on.

Here is a more detailed description of what the changes concern (by Han Chen):

For model 

Y = b_0 + b_cov1 * cov1 + b_cov2 * cov2 + ... + b_covN * covN + b_SNP * SNP + b_covX_SNP * covX * SNP

(1<=X<=N, covX can be any covariate in the phenotype file, from cov1 to covN, 
option --interaction=X, see ProbABEL manual for details) 
Or model 

Y = b_0 + b_cov1 * cov1 + b_cov2 * cov2 + ... + b_covX-1 * covX-1 + b_covX+1 * covX+1 + ... + b_covN * covN + b_SNP * SNP + b_covX_SNP * covX * SNP

(1<=X<=N, covX can be any covariate in the phenotype file, from cov1 to covN, 
option --interaction_only=X, see ProbABEL manual for details)
This "plus" version reports naive covariance (default) or robust covariance 
(option --robust) between b_SNP and b_covX_SNP estimates, for palinear and 
palogist (can NOT report covariance for pacoxph, Cox regression).
Covariances are no reported for options --score, --allcov, --mmscore

LINEAR REGRESSION OR LOGISTIC REGRESSION ONLY 

Bravo, Han! -- and many thanks! 


***** v.0.1-2 (2009.10.19)

Minor bug fix: allele frequency was estimated wrongly when option --ngpreds=2 
was used. The bug had no effect anything else (betas, ses, chi2s were correct).
Many thanks to Han Chen (Boston University) for identification of this bug 
and providing us with an excellent summary which allowed fixing the bug easily!

***** v.0.1-1 (2009.09.22)

Added "robust" option, which computes SEs using formula
(X'X)^(-1) (X' V X) (X'X)^(-1) where V is diagonal matrix containing
squares of residuals. In standard analysis, V is diagonal matrix 
containing constant = RSS/N

***** v.0.1-0 (2009.08.15)

fixed a bug in phedata class: if ID was starting with 'N' or 'n', it 
was counted as NA (thanks to Youfan & Ida Surakka for pointing the 
bug out)


***** v.0.0-9 (2009.07.20)

mmscore bug fixed (ses of betas were inflated by sd of the trait's distribution)


***** v.0.0-8 (2009.06.09)

1. New interaction option added. Key --interaction_only=<number> allows you to perform interaction analysis without covariate acting in ineraction.
Examlple: trait ~ cov1 + cov2 + cov3*SNP
In previos versions only models like trait ~ cov1 + cov2 + cov3 + cov3*SNP were possible

2. mmoscore option modified. Now any amount of covariates is possible.


***** v.0.0-7 (2009.03.19)

Bug with interaction in survival analysis fixed. 


***** v.0.0-6 (2009.01.28)

Added score test for association between a trait and genetic
polymorphism, in samples of related individuals.
Use key --mmscore <file with inverse of variance-covariance matrix>
File must contain the first column with id names like in phenotype file.
The rest is the matrix itself.
In case of mmscore phenotype file contain only two columns - id names and trait.

See example/mmscore.R and example/mmscore.sh.


***** v.0.0-5d (2009.01.11)

Possibility of analysis for SNP interaction has been added. 
New key is --interaction=<covariate number>.
Default is --interaction=0. The first covariate is --interaction=1.

Output organizing has been changed. Now there is one file per one model.
Output file names consist of prefix which goes together with input 
parameter --out and one of following postfixes:
"_2df.out.txt", "_add.out.txt", "_domin.out.txt", "_recess.out.txt", "_over_domin.out.txt".
If postfix is not given name "regression" is used.


File bin/probabel_system_example.pl has been changedand renamed 
to probabel.pl_example. This script combines all ProbABEL functions and allows 
you to organize work with your MACH output files. Just change configuration 
file probabel_config.cfg_example and probabel.pl_example like it is written in manual.

Now chi2 is likelihood ration test when null model is without SNP and alternative - with SNP and interaction.


***** v.0.0-5c (2008.12.05)

Changed presentation of output: effective allele (A1) is mentioned 
in exact manner


***** v.0.0-5b (2008.11.20)

Output from analysis with ngpred=2 (MLPROB files) fixed (models were 
named wrongly)


***** v.0.0-5a (2008.10.05)

--allcov option added (allows output of estimates for all covariates)

example system-wide perl script running the analysis for 
(potentially multiple cohorts) and joining single-chomosome 
outputs to single file provided

A change in the procedure to read genotypic files, read format of the 
beging of every line changed from "%d->%s" to "%[^->]->%[^->]" (thanks to 
Bertram Muller-Myhsok & Benno Puetz)


***** v.0.0-5 (2008.06.07)

More than one genomic predictor per point: possibility to 
work with MLPROB files (options --ngpreds added). 


***** v.0.0-4 (2008.05.20)

Score test implemented (palinear, palogistic)

Logistic regression: eps-loglikelihood change as convergence criterium


***** v.0.0-3

Survival analysis added

SNP Z and Chi-square statistics added to output

Output generated in tab-delimited format

Documentation updated
