***** v.0.1-0 (2009.08.15)

fixed a bug in phedata class: if ID was starting with 'N' or 'n', it 
was counted as NA (thanks to Youfan & Ida Surakka for pointing the 
bug out)


***** v.0.0-9 (2009.07.20)

mmscore bug fixed (ses of betas were inflated by sd of the trait's distribution)


***** v.0.0-8 (2009.06.09)

1. New interaction option added. Key --interaction_only=<number> allows you to perform interaction analysis without covariate acting in ineraction.
Examlple: trait ~ cov1 + cov2 + cov3*SNP
In previos versions only models like trait ~ cov1 + cov2 + cov3 + cov3*SNP were possible

2. mmoscore option modified. Now any amount of covariates is possible.


***** v.0.0-7 (2009.03.19)

Bug with interaction in survival analysis fixed. 


***** v.0.0-6 (2009.01.28)

Added score test for association between a trait and genetic
polymorphism, in samples of related individuals.
Use key --mmscore <file with inverse of variance-covariance matrix>
File must contain the first column with id names like in phenotype file.
The rest is the matrix itself.
In case of mmscore phenotype file contain only two columns - id names and trait.

See example/mmscore.R and example/mmscore.sh.


***** v.0.0-5d (2009.01.11)

Possibility of analysis for SNP interaction has been added. 
New key is --interaction=<covariate number>.
Default is --interaction=0. The first covariate is --interaction=1.

Output organizing has been changed. Now there is one file per one model.
Output file names consist of prefix which goes together with input 
parameter --out and one of following postfixes:
"_2df.out.txt", "_add.out.txt", "_domin.out.txt", "_recess.out.txt", "_over_domin.out.txt".
If postfix is not given name "regression" is used.


File bin/probabel_system_example.pl has been changedand renamed 
to probabel.pl_example. This script combines all ProbABEL functions and allows 
you to organize work with your MACH output files. Just change configuration 
file probabel_config.cfg_example and probabel.pl_example like it is written in manual.

Now chi2 is likelihood ration test when null model is without SNP and alternative - with SNP and interaction.


***** v.0.0-5c (2008.12.05)

Changed presentation of output: effective allele (A1) is mentioned 
in exact manner


***** v.0.0-5b (2008.11.20)

Output from analysis with ngpred=2 (MLPROB files) fixed (models were 
named wrongly)


***** v.0.0-5a (2008.10.05)

--allcov option added (allows output of estimates for all covariates)

example system-wide perl script running the analysis for 
(potentially multiple cohorts) and joining single-chomosome 
outputs to single file provided

A change in the procedure to read genotypic files, read format of the 
beging of every line changed from "%d->%s" to "%[^->]->%[^->]" (thanks to 
Bertram Muller-Myhsok & Benno Puetz)


***** v.0.0-5 (2008.06.07)

More than one genomic predictor per point: possibility to 
work with MLPROB files (options --ngpreds added). 


***** v.0.0-4 (2008.05.20)

Score test implemented (palinear, palogistic)

Logistic regression: eps-loglikelihood change as convergence criterium


***** v.0.0-3

Survival analysis added

SNP Z and Chi-square statistics added to output

Output generated in tab-delimited format

Documentation updated
