This file explains how to generate packages (deb, rpm) for different Linux
distributions.

* Debian (and Ubuntu) packages
** Install the necessary requirements
   The following packages need to be installed (in addition to the
   ones you need to compile the source anyway):
   - dh-make
   - fakeroot
   - lintian
** Building the package
   First check to see if everything compiles and all files are included
   in the automake files:
    ./configure
    make distcheck
   If there are no errors, a tar.gz file of the source should be
   created. Let's create the package.
    cd dist-packages/deb
   Debian packages must have lowercase letters, so we'll make a copy
   of the tar.gz file
    tar -xzf ../../ProbABEL-0.2-0-beta.tar.gz
    mv ProbABEL-0.2-0-beta probabel-0.2-0-beta
    cd probabel-0.2-0-beta
    dh_make --single --email youremail@example.com \
     --file ../probabel-0.2-0-beta.tar.gz --copyright gpl2 \
     --packagename probabel

   Hit the enter key to confirm the settings. Several files need to be
   edited (or at least checked to see if they are still up to date).
   - debian/control
   - debian/changelog
   - debian/copyright
   - debian/README.Debian
   dh_make also creates several example scripts in the debian/
   directory. We don't need them, so they can be delete:
    rm debian/*.ex
   Now the package can be built:
    dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -us -uc
   This creates a ~.deb~ file in the parent directory. As a
   final touch you can check you package for errors with
    lintian ../probabel_0.2-0-beta-1_amd64.deb
   Several warnings will show up (e.g. binaries without man-pages),
   but we ignore these for now. If you are interested in a more
   detailed explanation of the warnings, add the -i option to the
   lintian command.
