test input files, as well as any other relevant information related
the files in the inputfiles directory.

* The SNPs
  - SNP 1: Tests multi-letter alleles (indel, e.g. from 1kG) in Al1 (bug
           #2586).
  - SNP 2: Tests multi-letter alleles (indel, e.g. from 1kG) in Al2 (bug
           #2586); Tests NaN in genetic data.
  - SNP 3:
  - SNP 4:
  - SNP 5: Tests low Rsq in info file.
  - SNP 6: Tests low MAF, only one out of 200 people has a different dosage.
