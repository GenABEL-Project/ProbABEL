# Configuration file for the probabel.pl wrapper script
#
# This file contains the location of the files with imputed data for the
# cohorts/imputations that are available to the user.
#
# Use one line per cohort configuration. Each line consists of the following
# entries, separated by a comma:
# - cohort: a discriptive name for the cohort/imputation, e.g. MyCohort_HM2
# - mlinfo_path: path to the file with the SNP imputation information
# - mldose_path: path to the file with imputed genotype dosages
# - mlprob_path: path to the file with imputed genotype probabilities
# - legend_path: path to the legend file used for the imputations
#
# Use "_._chr_._" to specify a chromosome number in the configured paths. This
# can be used multiple times per line, e.g.:
#
# mldose_path: /data/Cohort1/MachFiles/_._chr_._/mach_._chr_._-out.mldose
#
# For chromosome 1 this will be replaced with:
#             /data/Cohort1/MachFiles/1/mach1-out.mldose
